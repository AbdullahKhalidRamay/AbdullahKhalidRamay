-	First we make 3 bit-asynchronous counter using j-k flip flop by help of 4- bit -asynchronous counter.
-	Then by using three outputs Q0,Q1,Q2 of  counter as input impulse to get A,B,C,D outputs.
-	K-maps to make logic A, B, C, D are:
A =Q0\Q1.Q2	00	01	11	10
0	0	1	0	1
1	1	1	0	1
A=Q0.Q1’+Q1’.Q2+Q1.Q2’
B =Q0\Q1.Q2	00	01	11	10
0	0	0	1	1
1	0	1	1	1
B=Q2+Q0.Q2
C =Q0\Q1.Q2	00	01	11	10

 - [Project 7](https://github.com/AbdullahKhalidRamay/digital-gate-project-7):Digital logical design project
 - 4COM2003.circ-T03L1e11
 - Build a circuit that has two 8-bit two’s complement numbers U and
 Was its inputs and a single 8-bit output Z, such that
 Z =2U+Wwhen U<W
 and Z =U+W otherwise.
 You are not allowed to use the Arithmetic and Plexers libraries; how
ever, an 8-bit adder, incrementer and multiplexer, implemented via gates,
 are provided on the design board for your convenience. Feel free to use
 them, or build your own if you prefer.
- [Project 8](https://github.com/AbdullahKhalidRamay/4COM2003.circ-T03L1e08):Digital logical design project
- 4COM2003.circ-T03L1e08
 - Build a circuit that has two 8-bit two’s complement numbers U and
 Wand a 1-bit S as its inputs, and a single 8-bit output Z, such that
 when S = 1, Z =U+5 and
 when S = 0, Z =2W.
 You are not allowed to use the Arithmetic and Plexers libraries; how
ever, an 8-bit adder, incrementer and multiplexer, implemented via gates,
 are provided on the design board for your convenience. Feel free to use
 them, or build your own if you prefer.
- [Project 9](https://github.com/AbdullahKhalidRamay/4COM2003.circ-T03L1e07):Digital logical design project
- 4COM2003.circ-T03L1e07
 - Build a circuit that has two 8-bit two’s complement numbers U and
 Was its inputs and a single 8-bit output Z, such that Z = 4 + U-W.
 You are not allowed to use the Arithmetic and Plexers libraries; how
ever, an 8-bit adder, incrementer and multiplexer, implemented via gates,
 are provided on the design board for your convenience. Feel free to use
 them, or build your own if you prefer.
- [Project 10](https://github.com/AbdullahKhalidRamay/4COM2003.circ-T03L1e04):Digital logical design project
  
- 4COM2003.circ-T03L1e04
- Build a circuit that has two 8-bit two’s complement numbers U and
 Was its inputs and a single 1-bit output R, which is 1 when W U is
 negative and 0 otherwise.
 You are not allowed to use the Arithmetic and Plexers libraries; how
ever, an 8-bit adder, incrementer and multiplexer, implemented via gates,

- [Project 11](https://github.com/AbdullahKhalidRamay/4COM2003.circ-T02L1e10):Digital logical design project
- 4COM2003.circ-T02L1e10
 - You are given a design board with two 4-bit input pins A and B and
 two output pins: a 4-bit Q and a 1-bit R. Build from gates a circuit that
 computes (A + B) 2 and asserts it on pin Q. The remainder from the
 division should be asserted on pin R. For example, if the input is 4 and
 2, the output should be 3 for Q and 0 for R, and if the input is 5 and
 2, your circuit should assert 4 on Q and 1 on R.
 Assume that A and B are 2’s complement numbers. Your solution
 should produce the correct result for any values of A and B.
 For your convenience, a one-bit adder circuit is provided in the tem
plate 4COM2003.circ-T02L1e10.circ attached. That circuit is named
 "one-bit-adder" and you can use it as a chip in your design. Please do
 not rename any circuits.
- [Project 12](https://github.com/AbdullahKhalidRamay/4COM2003.circ-T02L1e09):Digital logical design project
- 4COM2003.circ-T02L1e09
- You are given a design board with two input pins, a 6-bit pin A and
 a 6-bit pin B and one 6-bit output pin R.
 Build a circuit that asserts the absolute value A B on R. You will
 need a 6-bit 2-to-1 multiplexer for your solution, which you will have
 to build by yourself, since the use of the Plexer library is prohibited for
 this exercise. You may, however, take the 6-bit adder or subtractor from
 Logisim’s Arithmetic library to save you time, but remember that you
 have already built one earlier. It is always a good idea to reuse your own
 components since you know exactly how they work
- [Project 13](github.com/AbdullahKhalidRamay/4COM2003.circ-T02L1e04):Digital logical design project
-4COM2003.circ-T02L1e04
 You are given a design board with two input pins A and B and three
 output pins R, C.out and V. Build from gates a 6-bit signed-number
 subtractor circuit, which subtracts B from A asserting the difference on
 R and the carry-out on C.out. If subtraction causes a signed-number
 overflow, your circuit must assert 1 on V, otherwise V should be low.
 You may use and combine any of the circuits you have already
 built as the basis for this, but you may not use any of Logisim’s built
in arithmetic devices to solve this problem. Use the Logisim template
 4COM2003.circ-T02L1e04.circ attached as a starting point for your
 circuit. A one-bit full full adder is provided with the design board for
 your convenience
- [Project 14](https://github.com/AbdullahKhalidRamay/coin-operated-dispenser):Digital logical design project
- coin operated dispenser
- detail:
-Showing all stages in the process, design and show the implementation of a digital system using D-type flip-flops and the necessary combinatorial logic to meet the
- following specification:
- A coin operated water dispenser for car wash requires 40p for each operation. It can take in coins of value 20p and 10p up to the exact amount. No change is available.  --- Require indicators for ready and next coin.
